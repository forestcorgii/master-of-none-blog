# Love from the ground up
Hey, I'm not an expert when it comes to love, and I can prove that because I wouldn't be writing this in the first place if I'm not having any difficulties loving someone. 
So, what is Love? Please bear with me as I'm not trying to be cringy! I'm looking for a definite answer, an answer that would make you see Love as something that's less mysterious after you finish reading this. With that said, we will start looking into the cringiest definition of all time!

It is a profound phrase but much of it's profoundness are hidden by the simplicity of the phrase. It wouldn't stand the test of time if it's not relatable in any way. Anyway, why is it blind?

My current conception of Love is that it is a contract that binds you into a *shared identity*. Why love is blind? Because you 

Most people nowadays don't love themselves. But, for the sake of argument, let's just say that we prioritize ourselves way more than the others. Then there's no reason to make sacrifices for people in general because, well, what for? Is there a benefit in doing that?

Love is a means to survive in order to avoid extinction. 
It starts with a caveman mating with a cavewoman, giving birth after 9 months, and then living together for years with different responsibilities. The caveman hunts for food while the cavewoman take care of the offspring.

To a tribe, hunting in groups and allocating the food to the people. 
To a civilization, with a castle in a large plot if land, defended by a stone wall.

Rejection from the group means death. 
Rejection from a woman means "No, I don't think you should allow your genes to successfully propagate.", scary.

You cannot really define love because you can't grasp it. You can only define its characteristics and its symptoms. It's immaterial but it has its influence in the subjective world.

Love is what? Is it blind? blind to what then? To appearance and status?

Then, Love is agnostic to material things.

You can't really define Love properly because it does not exists in the material world. It's something we experience, it's a phenomenon.

When we love someone, we often say

"You are important to me"

"I cherish you"

"You are precious"

Suggesting that you put the things you love on top of your value structure. The reason could be irrelevant, it's just what we do when in love. OR it could be the case that having a shared identity for a set amount of time cause us to love someone. Is that why the symbol of love are two hearts merge into one?

It's a feeling we feel for the things at the top of our value structure. What's the feeling? To act on their best interest. To not let them experience any pain, physically and emotionally. But that isn't wise because there is a need for them to experience an optimal amount of suffering.

**Love is a spirit that possesses us.**

There is a goddess of love, Aphrodite. And She's not always good. Alluding to the fact that love can have a destructive tendencies.

Medusa, punished for being too beautiful. Her hair became snakes and when you look in her eyes, you'll be petrified. If we try to understand it deeply. We do have tendencies to be petrified by beauty. Because of her beauty, she became something inhuman, or just that the people around her fail to recognize that she's just unfortunately blessed with beauty.

**How should you act to someone you love?**

Do you shower them with all the riches? Serve them blindly, following every orders?

It doesn't sound right. You're robbing them the opportunity to grow which would lead them to suffer at some point.

**Do you help them reach their full potential?**

Well, who are you to decide what their potential is? You're just putting them at the pedestal and get angry when they fail to act according to your idealized version of them.

You love someone by guiding them towards the truth. You shoulder some of their burden and walk with them towards the kingdom of heaven(heaven is a state of being(as well as hell)).

**Love thy neighbors.**

What would the bible teaches us about Love?

**Love as an addiction, obsession.**

What causes addiction according to Dr. K is easy repetition of action and a probability of rewards.

In love, it's something like getting rewarded with a feint sense of becoming together which would felt really good. The desire for feeling it again keep going up, not realizing that it was all an illusion. At some point you'll become too invested that it feels like a waste to just give so you keep pushing on until you get rejected. There's a chance that you would give up but if your stubborn like me, no way in hell. That makes it an addiction, and it's bad because both sides are needlessly suffering.

**Liking and Loving**

Liking is the desire to have someone as part of your Identity. Loving is having someone become a part of your identity.

**Love born out of maternal instinct.**
